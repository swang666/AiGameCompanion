# AI Game Companion

**Ask an AI while you play -- without alt-tabbing.**

A transparent, always-on-top companion window that composites over your game and
lets you ask Google Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI questions in-game. Bring your own
provider, attach a screenshot for context, or translate on-screen text -- all
without ever leaving the game, and **without injecting anything into it**.

## Why

I built this for myself -- a way to ask an AI for a hint, a build, or a
translation while playing, without alt-tabbing to a browser and losing the
moment. Responses come from **Sage**, an in-game advisor drawn in a panel over
the running game.

Earlier versions injected a DLL and hooked the game's renderer. That was fragile
and looked like the thing anti-cheats flag, so it was **dropped entirely**. Sage
now runs as its **own transparent window** that Windows composites over the game
-- it never injects, never hooks a graphics API, and **cannot crash the game**.

It's deliberately **bring-your-own-AI**: Gemini talks to its own free API, while
Claude and OpenAI run through your *existing* CLI subscriptions -- no middleman
service, no shared keys. There's no telemetry, no analytics, and no account.

It's a personal tool, not a product -- open source under MIT. No adoption goal
and no support guarantees, but issues and PRs are read.

## Status

Actively developed personal tool, shipped as tagged Windows releases. It targets
**borderless / fullscreen-optimized** games (effectively all modern single-player
titles); genuine legacy exclusive-fullscreen games are out of scope. Treat it as
a working tool you can build and run, not a polished consumer app.

**Implemented:**
- External transparent overlay window -- topmost, click-through when idle, takes
  focus on demand; toggled with **Ctrl+Shift+G**. No injection, any graphics API.
- Multi-provider AI -- Gemini (direct API), Claude & OpenAI (through your own
  `claude` / `codex` CLIs), switchable from an in-panel dropdown that shows only
  available providers and persists your choice.
- Streaming "Sage" replies over a Tauri channel, multi-turn chat, Stop / New chat.
- Screenshot vision (Gemini + Claude) via **Windows.Graphics.Capture** -- capture
  the game frame with no injection; skipped for OpenAI (upstream Codex limitation).
- Screen translation (**Ctrl+Shift+T**) and quick-ask (**Ctrl+Shift+A**) hotkeys.
- Desktop launcher (Tauri 2 + Svelte 5) -- Steam library discovery, cover art,
  one-click launch, tray, launch-on-startup, and play-time via an external process
  watcher.
- In-app Settings: your Gemini key is stored in the **Windows Credential Manager**
  (not plaintext), plus CLI detection, a persisted default provider, and launcher
  toggles.

**Not done yet / out of scope:**
- OpenAI screenshots -- blocked on an upstream Codex CLI fix.
- Rebindable hotkeys -- the chords are fixed this build (Settings shows them).
- Positioning the panel over the game's specific monitor (it opens centered).
- Offline / local-model translation -- translation currently runs through Gemini.
- Genuine legacy exclusive-fullscreen games -- an external window can't composite
  over those; borderless / FSO windowed is covered.
- Competitive / kernel-anti-cheat titles are a non-goal.

## Features

### The overlay
- A transparent, frameless, always-on-top panel Windows composites over the game
  -- no DLL, no swapchain hook, works regardless of graphics API.
- **Ctrl+Shift+G** toggles it; while interactive it takes keyboard focus so your
  typing doesn't reach the game, then hands focus back on hide.

</p>

### Multi-provider AI
Sage can talk through **Gemini**, **Claude**, or **OpenAI** -- pick one from the
in-panel dropdown (only available providers are shown; the choice persists).

- **Gemini** -- direct API with a free key ([Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)),
  entered in Settings and stored in the OS Credential Manager.
- **Claude** -- your existing [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI, no separate key.
- **OpenAI** -- your existing [Codex CLI](https://openai.com/codex/), no separate key.

The CLIs are spawned directly as subprocesses -- the same pattern documented for
[headless Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless). No OAuth tokens
are extracted or shared; each user authenticates their own CLIs. Providers never
fall back to one another silently.

### Screenshot vision & translation
Attach the current frame to a question (Gemini / Claude) -- captured via
Windows.Graphics.Capture, no injection. Press **Ctrl+Shift+T** to translate
on-screen text through Gemini, or **Ctrl+Shift+A** to fire a preset question with
a screenshot attached.

### Desktop launcher
A Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 GUI for your library: Steam auto-discovery, Steam-CDN cover
art, one-click launch, play-time tracking via an external process watcher, tray,
launch-on-startup, and an in-app Settings panel (provider key + detection,
default provider, hotkey reference, launcher toggles).

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App | [Tauri 2][tauri] + [Svelte 5][svelte] + Tailwind 4 | One process, two windows: library + transparent overlay |
| Capture | [windows][windows] crate (WinRT) | Windows.Graphics.Capture -> D3D11 -> PNG; foreground-HWND game detection |
| Async / HTTP | [tokio][tokio] + [reqwest][reqwest] | Gemini streaming + CLI subprocesses off the UI thread |
| Shared state | [parking_lot][parking_lot] | Fast mutex for the shared app state |
| Secrets | [keyring][keyring] | Gemini key in the Windows Credential Manager |
| Build | [cargo-xwin][cargo-xwin] | MSVC cross-compile from WSL2 |
| Logging | [tracing][tracing] | Structured logs to `launcher.log` |

## Quick start

1. **Get a free Gemini key** at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
   -- no billing required. (Or skip it and use your existing Claude / OpenAI CLI.)
2. **Run** `launcher.exe`, open **Settings -> Providers**, and paste your Gemini
   key (stored in the Windows Credential Manager). Claude / OpenAI are detected
   automatically if their CLIs are installed.
3. **Play.** With a game in the foreground, press **Ctrl+Shift+G** to open Sage,
   type a question, and optionally attach the current frame. **Ctrl+Shift+T**
   translates on-screen text; **Ctrl+Shift+A** asks a preset question.

## Layout

```
├── Cargo.toml                  # workspace root
├── crates/
│   └── launcher/               # the whole app (Tauri 2 + Svelte 5)
│       ├── src/                # Svelte frontend (runes): library + overlay UI
│       └── src-tauri/          # Rust backend: overlay window, WGC capture,

├── config.example.toml         # optional legacy key fallback (no real key)
└── scripts/build.sh            # release build -> release/
```

## Building from source

Built from WSL2 with [`cargo-xwin`][cargo-xwin] -- no native Visual Studio needed.

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo install cargo-xwin
sudo apt install clang lld llvm

cargo xwin build -p launcher --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc   # debug
./scripts/build.sh                                              # release -> release/
```

Lint + test gates:

```bash
cargo xwin clippy -p launcher --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -- -D warnings
cargo test -p launcher    # pure-logic tests; run on the Linux host
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Overlay doesn't appear over the game** -- use borderless / fullscreen-windowed
  mode; a topmost window can't composite over true exclusive fullscreen.
- **Claude / OpenAI missing from the dropdown** -- their CLIs may still be
  detecting (especially under WSL); open Settings and press **Re-check CLIs**.
- **Screenshot is black** -- some protected/DRM content or minimized windows can't
  be captured via Windows.Graphics.Capture; try borderless.
- **Gemini errors** -- "invalid key" re-enter it in Settings; "rate limited" the
  free tier allows roughly 250 requests/day.

## Design principles

1. **Can't crash the game.** Sage is a separate window, not injected code -- a bug
   in the companion never takes the game down with it.
2. **Bring your own AI, no middleman.** Gemini talks direct; Claude / OpenAI spawn
   your own authenticated CLIs. No tokens extracted, no shared service.
3. **No silent fallback.** Providers never switch behind your back -- a failed
   request fails loudly rather than leaking your prompt to a different vendor.
4. **Secrets stay secret.** A Gemini key entered in Settings lives in the Windows
   Credential Manager. A key left in a legacy `config.toml` is still read from
   there in plaintext, so move it into Settings and clear the file.
5. **No telemetry or analytics.** Nothing reports usage back to us. Two outbound
   requests are worth knowing about anyway: the UI loads its fonts from Google
   Fonts at startup, and Gemini requests enable Google Search grounding, so a
   prompt sent to Gemini can reach Google Search.
